description: "Christine is purportedly a compilation of letters from a \"gifted young\
  \ English girl studying in Germany just before the outbreak of the war\" (Charms\
  \ 188) to her mother in Britain. Written by Elizabeth von Arnim and presented under\
  \ her anonymous pen-name Alice Cholmondeley, the work dated from May 28, 1914 to\
  \ August 4, 1914, the letters were published in 1917. \"Christine\" explained her\
  \ experience with German pre-war culture; however, Christine did not exist. She\
  \ was a fictional character that some claim was Arnim's attempt at anti-German propaganda.\
  \ These detailed letters helped to convey a picture to British citizens of the supposed\
  \ state of mind of the German public during the chaotic days leading up to World\
  \ War I.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
